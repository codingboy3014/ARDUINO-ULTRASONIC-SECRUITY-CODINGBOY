Wiring
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):


WIRING
VCC → 5V on Arduino
GND → GND on Arduino
TRIG → Digital Pin 9 on Arduino
ECHO → Digital Pin 10 on Arduino
LED (or Buzzer):

Positive leg (longer leg of LED or positive terminal of buzzer) → Digital Pin 8 on Arduino
Negative leg (shorter leg of LED or negative terminal of buzzer) → GND on Arduino (with 220Ω resistor if using LED)
